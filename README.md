# ARyouthereyet : See places around you with your camera!

### How to build it:
Clone the master branch and build the app using Xcode 9 or above. The app will run on any iPhone above the iPhone 6 due to requirements of ARKit. Replace the Google places API key a newly generated token before building it.

Note: Just to be safe, reorient your digital compass by rotating your phone in the shaoe of an 'infinity'. It will recalibrate the compass in the phone.
